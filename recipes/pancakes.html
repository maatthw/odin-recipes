        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These delicious breakfast cakes are said to resemble those from a famous pancake house. When replacing milk for buttermilk, increase lemon juice to 1 1/2 tablespoons. Serve topped with butter.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
                <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 dash salt</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Mix buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla in a bowl; stir in sugar.
                    Whisk in flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, combining the batter with just a few strokes to moisten.
                    Leave the lumps.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Whisk egg and lemon juice together in a separate bowl;
                    gently stir into the batter. Refrigerate for at least
                    30 minutes, up to 1 hour.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and grease with the
                    butter. Pour 1/3 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet
                    and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Flip with spatula and brown the other side, about 2 more minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
